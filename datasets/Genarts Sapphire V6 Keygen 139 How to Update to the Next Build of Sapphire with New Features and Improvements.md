## Applying and Customizing Sapphire Effects and Transitions
 
To apply a Sapphire effect or transition to your video clip, simply drag and drop it from the Effects panel in your host application. You can then adjust the parameters of the effect or transition in the Effect Controls panel. You can also use keyframes to animate the parameters over time.
 
For example, let's say you want to add some glow to your clip. You can use the S\_Glow effect from the Sapphire Lighting category. Drag and drop it onto your clip and then open the Effect Controls panel. You will see a list of parameters that you can tweak to change the look of the glow. You can change the brightness, color, threshold, width, shape, and more. You can also use keyframes to make the glow fade in or out.

You can apply multiple Sapphire effects to a single clip by stacking them in the Effect Controls panel. You can also use blending modes and opacity to control how the effects interact with each other and with the original clip.
 
## Using the Effect and Transition Builder to Create Your Own Effects
 
If you want to create your own custom effects or transitions, you can use the Sapphire Effect and Transition Builder. The Builder is a node-based interface that lets you combine different Sapphire effects and parameters to create new effects. You can also save your custom effects as presets and share them with other users.
 
To access the Builder, you need to apply either the S\_Effect or S\_Transition effect from the Sapphire Builder category. The S\_Effect is for creating custom effects and the S\_Transition is for creating custom transitions. Once you apply either of these effects, you will see a button that says Edit Effect or Edit Transition in the Effect Controls panel. Clicking on this button will open the Builder interface.
 
In the Builder interface, you will see a node graph that represents your custom effect or transition. You can add new nodes by clicking on the Add Node button at the top left corner of the interface. You can then choose from a list of Sapphire effects or other nodes such as inputs, outputs, masks, blends, etc. You can connect the nodes by dragging their input and output ports together. You can also adjust the parameters of each node in the Node Parameters panel on the right side of the interface.
 
For example, let's say you want to create a custom transition that combines a blur and a wipe effect. You can use the Builder to create this transition by following these steps:

1. Apply the S\_Transition effect to your video clip.
2. Click on Edit Transition in the Effect Controls panel.
3. Add an S\_Blur node by clicking on Add Node > Sapphire Blur > S\_Blur.
4. Add an S\_Wipe node by clicking on Add Node > Sapphire Transitions > S\_Wipe.
5. Connect the output port of S\_Blur to one of the input ports of S\_Wipe.
6. Connect another input port of S\_Wipe to Background Input 1 node.
7. Connect another 8cf37b1e13
