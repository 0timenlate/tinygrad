Battlefield 2142 is a futuristic first-person shooter game that was released in 2006 by DICE and Electronic Arts. The game features two military superpowers, the European Union and the Pan Asian Coalition, fighting for survival in a new ice age. One of the game modes is Titan, where players have to capture missile silos and destroy the enemy's flying warship.
 
However, if you want to play this mode offline with bots, you need a mod called Titan Lite 2. This mod allows you to play all the maps in a Titan-like environment, where you can capture flags and launch missiles at the enemy Titan. The mod also includes some weapon and vehicle tweaks, as well as FFOLKES unlocks\_v1.06, which gives you access to all the weapons and gadgets in the game.
