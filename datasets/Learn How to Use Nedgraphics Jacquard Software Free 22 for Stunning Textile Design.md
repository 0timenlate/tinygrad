## What is Nedgraphics Jacquard Software?
 
Nedgraphics Jacquard Software is a comprehensive textile design software that helps you create highly realistic fabric simulations for any type of jacquard fabric, such as upholstery, terry, ties, velvet or labels. You can use it to visualize your fabric and weave structure in real-time, create and store basic and compound weaves in libraries, automatically generate weft and warp scales from the design, integrate float checking and correcting, convert to and from any weaving machine, and use the true coloring tool to recolor the simulations[^2^].
 
Nedgraphics Jacquard Software comes in three versions: Jacquard, Jacquard Pro and Jacquard Enterprise. Jacquard is the introductory version that offers an attractive price tag and lowers the threshold for adding stations.

Jacquard Enterprise is the ultimate solution that offers a high quality simulation engine and the True Coloring module to create and recolor highly realistic virtual samples[^2^].
