## Method 1: Search for PDF Files Online
  
One of the easiest ways to find a PDF file of any book is to search for it online using a search engine like Google or Bing. You can simply type in the title of the book followed by "PDF" or "PDF download" and see what results come up. For example, you can try searching for "Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems 5th Edition PDF" or "Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems 5th Edition PDF download".
  
However, this method is not very reliable or safe. You might encounter some problems such as:
  
- The PDF file might not be the correct edition or version of the book you are looking for.
- The PDF file might be incomplete, corrupted, or have poor quality.
